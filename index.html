People were fed up with the past government styles and the current democracy which had done nothing good for them. They wanted one person to lead or control the country so they voted in the Nazi party. They knew the risks but they didn’t overthrow the fact that he could help the country pick itself up again<br></p>

On the 30th of January, 1933, Hitler was appointed the Chancellor of Germany. During this time, Anti Semitism was promoted by the Nazi party using propaganda. This was to gain support for future policies that they were planning. During 1933-39, Anti Semitism in Germany was rising rapidly, as well as ideology of other religions, races, sexualities etc.<br></p>

In 1919, Hitler joined the German Workers party and only 2 years later, he became the leader.<br><br>At one point, they attempted to overthrow the government at the time which ended with Hitler in jail. This is where he wrote Mein Kampf - a memoir covering all his ideologies about the 'aryan race' and the Jews and what he was planning to do to get the 'aryan race' (blond hair, blue eyes, German ancestry, tall, not Jewish)<br><br>After WWI, Germany was in a bad state. The treaty of Versailles was written and signed. Germany was to pay for all of the damage that was caused in WWI which meant that the economy, society and political landcape was effected. Germany was running low on money so the government thought that if they printed more money, their problems would be solved, but instead, this lead to hyperinflation - decrese in value of the local currency.<br><br>	In 1933, Hitler legally came to power as he was elected the Chancellor of Germany. A year later he became the Fürher (Leader of Germany). In 1935, two distinct laws were enforced called 'The Nuremberg Laws'. these laws alligned with his ideoligy of Jews being inferior.<br></p>

However, as the original poster is an official government sponsored publication from 1935, its primary purpose would have been to inform people of and promote the government’s position in relation to German citizenship and the marriage of people with Jewish ancestry.  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the author agrees with this content.<br>The Nuremberg laws discriminate against people who are Jews or who have a Jewish background, regardless of other factors such as gender or rank. <br>Another clue from this source that suggests the author is supportive of the Nuremberg laws is the way that coloured symbols are used to represent German citizens (white circles, depicting racial purity) compared to the Jews (black circles, suggesting the opposite).<br></p>

It provides a simple, easy to understand summary of these laws, while also providing insight to modern day researchers on the extent to which Jewish people were deprived of their rights.<br>This particular source is useless in expanding our knowledge or understanding of the feelings and emotions of the people who lived in Germany when the Nuremberg laws were passed, or the impact of these laws on the community.  This is because its purpose is simply to inform the people of the new laws; the people’s response to those laws would most likely have happened later.   Historians researching this topic will need to supplement their research with other sources such as diary records and letters, however it is likely that most of these are unlikely to have been preserved due to the persecution of Jews during WWII.<br></p>

The source shows that the author is supporting the anti-Semitic position of the government therefore making this source highly unreliable as it is one sided and biased. Because of this, the source would only be useful for the historian on the basis that they were studying anti-Semitism, to understand that only one side was ever really shown and was very opinionated and unrealistic.</p>

New York: Harper Collins.&nbsp;<br>	Michael Berenbaum suggests that the Nuremberg laws represented “the first step towards destruction” of the Jewish people in Europe.&nbsp;<br>	<br>	I think that Michael Berenbaum is saying that the legalisation of anti-Semitism would lead to greater things (the final solution)<br>	<br><strong>	Historian: &nbsp;</strong>Tony Platt &amp; Cecilia O’Leary (2005) Bloodlines: Recovering Hitler’s Nuremberg Laws. Paradigm Publishers.&nbsp;<br>	Anthony Platt and Ceciilia O’Leary argue in this book that “The Nuremberg Laws codified segregation and anti-Semitism into legislation” making anti-Semitism law, and no longer simply common practice.<br>	<br>	The two historians here are stating that anti-Semitism and segregation were organized into laws, completely discriminating Jews making everything they could possibly need or want illegal and inaccessible.<br></p>
